# 🛡️ Windows Firewall Manager (ports.py)

Windows Firewall Manager is my first custom-built **firewall control project**,  
designed to manage ports and connections directly through Python.  
It allows users to **block, unblock, and monitor ports**, as well as  
enable logging for dropped packets, and export/import firewall rules.  

The program supports **3 free attempts** for blocking/unblocking ports  
without signing in, and **unlimited attempts after email verification**  
using a simple offline format check.  

This tool is lightweight, requires **no external modules**, and integrates  
seamlessly with Windows Firewall using built-in system commands.
